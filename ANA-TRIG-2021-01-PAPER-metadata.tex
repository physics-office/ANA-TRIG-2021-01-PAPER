\AtlasAbstract{%

Electron trigger identification is a crucial input to many ATLAS physics analysis. To cope with the increase of peak LHC luminosity from 2017 to 2018, and a similar increase in the number of interactions per beam-crossing to about 60, trigger algorithms and selections were optimised to control the rates while retaining a high efficiency for physics analyses. 
In the second half of 2017, the Neural-Ringer algorithm, which is a set of Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) models, replaced such a cut-based strategy in the FastCalo decision step and became the baseline algorithm for triggering events containing electrons above 15 GeV, as part of the ATLAS online system CPU reduction campaign. 
It was the first time a neural network method was employed as a baseline selection algorithm for event selection in the ATLAS trigger system
which results in a higher background early rejection strategy, at least 13 times with respect to the cut-based, while maintaining electron efficiency nearly unchanged.
